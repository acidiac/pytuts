While in Supervised Learning problem we are given a datasets which has labelled and there is an explicit
reference to the solution

Unsupervised Learning:
in unsupervised learning we are not given labels with the datasets and we are not told what to do with it. 
Here we are just given data and we try to find a structure. This structure could take many forms
Clustering:
	when the given dataset can be grouped as clusters. This is used in many cases for example
	-Google News which looks at loads of news from around and groups them into cohesive stories,
	-Clustering algorithms are also used in genomics for clustering people based on gene expressions
	-organizing large computer clusters in data center
	-Social Network analysis to identify cohesive groups
	-Market segmentation and customer segment discovery
	-Astronomical data analysis
